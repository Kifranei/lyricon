The 9999.0-...\n    version number is enough for some build systems (notably, Gradle) to select\n    that empty artifact over the \"real\" listenablefuture-1.0 -- avoiding a\n    conflict with the copy of ListenableFuture in guava itself. If users are\n    using an older version of Guava or a build system other than Gradle, they\n    may see class conflicts. If so, they can solve them by manually excluding\n    the listenablefuture artifact or manually forcing their build systems to\n    use 9999.0-....",
